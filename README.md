## Data Structures

### Arrays
Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow constant-time access to elements but have a fixed size.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion but slower access times compared to arrays.

### Stacks
Stacks follow a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. They are useful for problems involving recursion, backtracking, and function call management.

### Queues
Queues follow a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. They are used in scenarios like task scheduling and handling requests in order.

### Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Heaps are common types.

### Graphs
Graphs consist of vertices and edges. They are used to model networks, relationships, and various problems in computer science.

## Algorithms

### Sorting
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order. Common algorithms include:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching
Searching algorithms find the position of an element in a data structure. Examples include:
- Binary Search
- Linear Search

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

### Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms handle problems related to graph traversal, shortest paths, and connectivity. Key algorithms include:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
